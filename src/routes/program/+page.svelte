        The curriculum of Care and Fun is based on a combination of many
        teaching methods, including the Reggio Emilia model, learning through
        play, Waldorf and basic Montessori. The emergent curriculum at Care and
        Fun is created to foster intelligence and give kids every chance to
        succeed and develop to their full potential by fostering their innate
        interests and curiosity.

        With the notion that we value and enjoy the basic things in life, a
        sense of community will be strengthened. Participation, creating a
        garden, and letting kids create learning materials based on their
        interests are all ways to demonstrate this. Our program incorporates
        both indoor and outdoor games, group projects, science, social studies,
        and math activities, as well as activities that encourage language and
        literature abilities because children learn through play. We do this
        during circle times, which include books, stories, a variety of props
        and puppets, among other things. Games, puzzles, water and sand play,
        housekeeping, theatre, blocks, building zone, clay and play dough and
        other activities are available at the daycare. The daily routine will be
        followed by the teachers and children, so that children can develop
        their skills.
